\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Total functional programming... and its relationship to type theory.

Use folds and unfolds to construct total recursive programs. Can
construct quite comfortable recursion combinators. See McBride.

Could also write corecursion programs using unfolds, but this seems
difficult, and in particular makes the ``state'' explicit, which
completely changes the operational behaviour.

Syntactic guardedness checks work, but are very awkward to program
with.

Can use guarded recursion, but Nakano's system loses the distinction
between inductive and coinductive types. We would like to keep this
distinction.

In the remainder of this introductory section, we ...

\subsection{Guardedness Checkers and Guarded Recursion}

Several systems with support for corecursion, such as Coq and Agda,
currently make use of syntactic guardedness checks to ensure
productivity of programs defined using corecursion. Without these
checks, soundness of these systems cannot be guaranteed. An
unfortunate aspect of these guardedness checks is their
non-compositionality. We now demonsrate the problem with an example,
and see how the guarded recursion of Nakano can be used to provide a
type-based guardedness check.

We will use Haskell notation for each of our informal examples, since
it serves to illustrate the issues concisely. Consider the following
Haskell declaration of a type of infinite streams of integers:
\begin{displaymath}
  \kw{data}\ \tyname{Stream} = \cons{StreamCons}\ \tyname{Integer}\ \tyname{Stream}
\end{displaymath}
% FIXME: something about (co)data coincidence

An example of a $\tyname{Stream}$ is the infinite stream of $1$s:
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \defn{ones} :: \tyname{Stream} \\
    \defn{ones} = \cons{StreamCons}\ 1\ \ident{ones}
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
It is easy to see that this recursive definition is \emph{guarded};
$\ident{ones}$ is only invoked recursively within an application of
the stream constructor $\cons{StreamCons}$. This definition of
$\ident{ones}$ defines an infinite data structure, but each piece of
the data structure is delivered to us in finite time.

An example of a non-guarded definition is the filter function,
extended from finite lists to infinite streams:
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \defn{filter} :: (\tyname{Integer} \to \tyname{Bool}) \to \tyname{Stream} \to \tyname{Stream} \\
    \defn{filter}\ \ident{f}\ (\cons{StreamCons}\ \ident{z}\ \ident{s}) = \\
    \hspace{0.5cm}\kw{if }\ident{f}\ \ident{z}\kw{ then }\ident{filter}\ \ident{f}\ \ident{s}\kw{ else }\cons{StreamCons}\ \ident{z}\ (\ident{filter}\ \ident{f}\ \ident{s})
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
This definition is not guarded: in the $\kw{then}$-case of the
conditional, the recursive call to $\ident{filter}$ is not within an
application of the stream constructor $\cons{StreamCons}$. In this
case, the syntactic guardedness checker is right to reject this
definition: consider the case when all of the elements of the stream
are filtered out; $\ident{filter}$ will never return anything, and so
will be non-productive.

Syntactic guardedness checkers are not always so helpful. The
following higher-order function defines a general merge function on
pairs of streams:
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \defn{mergef} :: (\tyname{Integer} \to \tyname{Integer} \to \tyname{Stream} \to \tyname{Stream}) \to \\
    \textcolor{white}{\textrm{mergef} :: }\tyname{Stream} \to \tyname{Stream} \to \tyname{Stream} \\
    \defn{mergef}\ \ident{f}\ (\cons{StreamCons}\ \ident{x}\ \ident{xs})\ (\cons{StreamCons}\ \ident{y}\ \ident{ys}) = \\
    \quad\quad \ident{f}\ \ident{x}\ \ident{y}\ (\ident{mergef}\ \ident{f}\ \ident{xs}\ \ident{ys})
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
Any syntactic checker looking for constructors to guard recursive
calls will reject this function: there are no constructors anywhere in
the definition! This rejection is with good reason: there are
functions that we could pass to $\ident{mergef}$ that would render it
unproductive. For example, this function will cause $\ident{mergef}$
to hang on all pairs of streams:
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \defn{badf} :: \tyname{Integer} \to \tyname{Integer} \to \tyname{Stream} \to \tyname{Stream} \\
    \defn{badf}\ \ident{x}\ \ident{y}\ \ident{s} = \ident{s}
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
On the other hand, there are plenty of good functions $\ident{f}$ that
we could use with $\ident{mergef}$ to obtain productive functions, but
a syntactic guardedness checker does not allow us to express this
fact.

A possible way out of this problem is to retain the syntactic
guardedness check, and work around it by changing the type of
$\ident{f}$. For instance, we could change required type of
$\ident{f}$ to
\begin{displaymath}
  \ident{f} :: \tyname{Integer} \to \tyname{Integer} \to \tyname{Integer}
\end{displaymath}
to allow for merging functions that operate element-wise. Or we could
change the type to
\begin{displaymath}
  \ident{f} :: \tyname{Integer} \to \tyname{Integer} \to (\tyname{Integer}, [\tyname{Integer}])
\end{displaymath}
which would allow for the functional argument to replace each pair of
elements from the input streams with a non-empty list of values. The
general trick is to make $\ident{f}$ return ``instructions'' on how to
transform the stream back to $\ident{mergef}$, which then executes
them in a way that the syntactic guardedness checker can see is
guarded. However, it is difficult to see whether we could capture all
the possibilities for good $\ident{f}$s in a single type. We could
give yet another type which would accommodate the behaviour of the
following possible value of $\ident{f}$:
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \defn{f}\ \ident{x}\ \ident{y}\ \ident{s} = \cons{StreamCons}\ \ident{x}\ (\ident{map}\ (+\ident{y})\ \ident{s})
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
Incorporating the forms of all the possible productive definitions
into a single type seems impractical. Moreover, we complicate the
definition of $\ident{mergef}$, which is now forced to become
essentially an implementation of a virtual machine for running little
stream transformer programs returned by its functional argument.

A more promising type-based solution is provided by Nakano
\cite{nakano00FIXME}. Nakano introduces a guardedness type constructor
that represents values that may only be used in a guarded way. Thus
Nakano transports the guardedness checks from the syntactic level into
the type system. We write this constructor, applied to a type $A$, as
$\rhd A$ (Nakano uses the notation $\bullet A$, but the $\rhd A$
notation has become more common, and conveys an intuitive idea of
movement in time). A useful way to think of $\rhd A$ is as a value of
$A$ that is only available ``tomorrow''; the temporal gap between
today and tomorrow can only be bridged by the application of a
constructor such as $\cons{StreamCons}$. The reading of $\rhd A$ as a
value of $A$ tomorrow is explicitly supported in step-indexed
semantics by means of a clock counting down to
zero. %FIXME: forward ref, and refs to other peoples semantics

We now alter the type of $\ident{f}$ to be:
\begin{displaymath}
  \ident{f} :: \tyname{Integer} \to \tyname{Integer} \to \rhd\tyname{Stream} \to \tyname{Stream}
\end{displaymath}
This type captures the intution that the stream argument to
$\ident{f}$ must be only be used in a guarded way. To introduce
guarded types into the system, we must make some changes to the types
of our primitives. We alter the type of the construct
$\cons{StreamCons}$ as follows, and also introduce a stream
deconstructor that we previously implicitly used via pattern matching:
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \cons{StreamCons} :: \tyname{Integer} \to \rhd\tyname{Stream} \to \tyname{Stream} \\
    \elim{deStreamCons} :: \tyname{Stream} \to (\tyname{Integer}, \rhd\tyname{Stream})
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
The type of $\cons{StreamCons}$ shows that it takes a stream that may
only be used guardedly, and produces a stream without the guardedness
restriction. This is in line with the temporal intuition we have of
the type $\rhd\tyname{Stream}$. The inverse operation
$\elim{deStreamCons}$ takes a full stream and returns the integer and
the \emph{guarded} remainder of the stream.

To give the guardedness type constructor force, Nakano proposes the
following alternative type of the fixpoint operator:
\begin{displaymath}
  \kw{fix} :: (\rhd A \to A) \to A
\end{displaymath}
The standard typing of the $\kw{fix}$ operator is $(A \to A) \to
A$. Nakano's alternative typing ensures that recursive definitions
must be guarded by only allowing access to recursively generated
values ``tomorrow''.

To actually program with the guardedness constructor, we equip it with
the structure of an applicative functor \cite{paterson08applicative}:
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \kw{pure} :: A \to \rhd A \\
    \kw{$(\circledast)$} :: \rhd (A \to B) \to \rhd A \to \rhd B
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
Nakano uses an system of subtyping with respect to the guardedness
type constructor that has a similar effect to assuming that $\rhd$ is
an applicative functor. We propose to treat $\rhd$ applicative functor
here, due to the greater ease with which it can be incorporated into a
standard functional programming language like Haskell. Note that
$\rhd$ is not a monad: a join operation of type $\rhd(\rhd A) \to \rhd
A$ would allow us to collapse multiple guardedness obligations. Our
model in \autoref{sec:semantics} refutes the existence of a join
operator for $\rhd$.

With the guardedness type constructor, and its applicative functor
structure, we can rewrite the $\ident{mergef}$ function to allow the
alternative typing which only allows functional arguments that will
lead to productive definitions.
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \defn{mergef} :: (\tyname{Integer} \to \tyname{Integer} \to \rhd\tyname{Stream} \to \tyname{Stream}) \to \\
    \textcolor{white}{\textrm{mergef} :: }\ \tyname{Stream} \to \tyname{Stream} \to \tyname{Stream} \\
    \defn{mergef}\ \ident{f} = \kw{fix}\ (\lambda \ident{g}\ \ident{xs}\ \ident{ys}. \\
    \hspace{2.5cm} \kw{let}\ (\ident{x}, \ident{xs'}) = \elim{deStreamCons}\ \ident{xs} \\
    \hspace{2.5cm} \textcolor{white}{\kw{let}\ }(\ident{y}, \ident{ys'}) = \elim{deStreamCons}\ \ident{ys} \\
    \hspace{2.5cm} \kw{in}\ \ident{f}\ \ident{x}\ \ident{y}\ (\ident{g} \circledast \ident{xs'} \circledast \ident{ys'}))
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
Aside from the explicit uses of $\kw{fix}$ and $\elim{deStreamCons}$,
which were hidden by syntactic sugar in our previous definition, the
only substantial changes to the definition are the uses of applicative
functor apply ($\circledast$). These uses indicate operations that are
occuring under a guardedness type constructor.

\subsection{From Infinite to Finite}

The type system for guarded recursion that we described above allows
us to remove the syntactic guardedness check and replace it with a
type-based one. However, aside from proposing applicative functor
structure as a convienent way to incorporate the guardedness type
constructor into a functional language, we have not gone much beyond
Nakano's original system. We now describe a problem with basic guarded
recursion when attempting to combine infinite and finite data. We
propose a solution to this problem in the
\hyperref[sec:clock-vars]{next subsection}.

Consider the $\ident{take}$ function that reads a finite prefix of an
infinite stream into a list. This function will have the following type:
\begin{displaymath}
  \defn{take} :: \tyname{Natural} \to \tyname{Stream} \to [\tyname{Integer}]
\end{displaymath}
where we wish to regard the type $[\tyname{Integer}]$ as the type of
\emph{finite} lists of integers. The explicit segregation of
well-founded and non-well-founded types is important for our intended
applications of total functional programming and theorem proving.

We also assume that the type $\tyname{Natural}$ of natural numbers is
well-founded, so we may attempt to write $\ident{take}$ by structural
recursion on its first argument. However, we run into a difficulty,
which we have \colorbox{greybg}{highlighted}.
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \defn{take} :: \tyname{Natural} \to \tyname{Stream} \to [\tyname{Integer}] \\
    \defn{take}\ 0\ \ident{s} = [] \\
    \defn{take}\ (\ident{n}+1)\ \ident{s} = \ident{x} \mathop{\cons{:}} \ident{take}\ \ident{n}\ \colorbox{greybg}{$\ident{s'}$} \\
    \quad \kw{where}\ (\ident{x}, \ident{s'}) = \elim{deStreamCons}\ \ident{s}
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
The problem is that the variable $\ident{s'}$, which we have obtained
from $\elim{deStreamCons}$, has type $\rhd\tyname{Stream}$. However,
to invoke the $\ident{take}$ function structurally recursively, we
need something of type $\tyname{Stream}$, without the guardedness
restriction.

We analyse this problem in terms of our intuitive reading of
$\rhd\tyname{Stream}$ as a stream that is available
``tomorrow''. Nakano's typing discipline slices the construction of
infinite data like $\tyname{Stream}$ into discrete steps. In contrast,
a well-founded data type like $[\tyname{Integer}]$ lives entirely in
the moment. While a stream is being constructed, this slicing is
required so that we do not get ahead of ourselves and attempt to build
things today from things that will only be available tomorrow. But
once a stream has been fully constructed, we ought to be able to blur
the distinctions between the days of its construction. We accomplish
this in our type system by means of \emph{clock variables}, and
quantification over them.

\subsection{Clock Variables}
\label{sec:clock-vars}

We extend the type system with \emph{clock variables} $\kappa$. A
clock variable $\kappa$ represents an individual time sequence that
can be used for safe construction of infinite data like streams. In
our model, clock variables are interpreted as counters running down to
zero in the style of step-indexed models \cite{mcallester-appel}. By
quantifying over all counters we are able to accommodate all possible
finite observations on an infinite data structure.

We annotate the guardedness type constructor with a clock variable to
indicate which time stream we are considering: $\delay\kappa
A$. Infinite data types such as streams are now annotated by their
clock variable, indicating the time stream that they are being
constructed on. We have the following new types for the constructor
and deconstructor:
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \cons{StreamCons$^\kappa$} :: \tyname{Integer} \to \delay\kappa \tyname{Stream}^\kappa \to \tyname{Stream}^\kappa \\
    \elim{deStreamCons$^\kappa$} :: \tyname{Stream}^\kappa \to (\tyname{Integer}, \delay\kappa\tyname{Stream}^\kappa)    
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
We now regard the type $\tyname{Stream}^\kappa$ as the type of
infinite streams in the process of construction. A finished infinite
stream is represented by \emph{quantifying} over the relevant clock
variable: $\forall \kappa. \tyname{Stream}^\kappa$. If we think of
each possible downward counting counter that $\kappa$ could represent,
then this universally quantified type allows for any counter large
enough to allow us a given finite extraction of data from the
stream. We use the notation $\Lambda\kappa. e$ and $e[\kappa]$ to
indicate clock abstraction and application respectively, in the style
of explicitly typed System F type abstraction and application.

The fixpoint operator is parameterised by the clock variable:
\begin{displaymath}
  \kw{fix} :: \forall \kappa. (\delay\kappa A \to A) \to A
\end{displaymath}
as is the applicative functor structure carried by $\delay\kappa$:
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \kw{pure} :: \forall \kappa. A \to \delay\kappa A \\
    \kw{$(\circledast)$} :: \forall \kappa. \delay\kappa (A \to B) \to \delay\kappa A \to \delay\kappa B
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
We also add an additional piece of structure to eliminate guarded
types that have been universally quantified:
\begin{displaymath}
  \kw{force} :: (\forall \kappa.\ \delay\kappa A) \to (\forall \kappa.\ A)
\end{displaymath}
Intuitively, if we have a value that, for any time stream, is one time
step away, we simply instantiate it with a time stream that is one
step greater and extract the value. Note that the universal
quantification is required on the right hand side since $\kappa$ may
appear free in the type $A$. The $\kw{force}$ operator has a similar
flavour to the $\kw{runST} :: (\forall s. \tyname{ST}\ s\ a) \to a$
for the $\tyname{ST}$ monad
\cite{DBLP:journals/jfp/MoggiS01,launchbury-spj-FIXME}. In both cases,
rank-2 quantification is used to prevent values from ``leaking'' out
from the context in which it is safe to use them.

Using $\kw{force}$ we may write a deconstructor for completed streams
of type $\forall \kappa. \tyname{Stream}^\kappa$.
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \elim{deStreamCons} :: (\forall \kappa. \tyname{Stream}^\kappa) \to (\tyname{Integer}, \forall \kappa. \tyname{Stream}^\kappa) \\
    \elim{deStreamCons}\ \ident{x} = \\
    \quad\quad
    \begin{array}[t]{l}
      (\Lambda \kappa. \kw{fst}\ (\elim{deStreamCons}^\kappa\ (\ident{x}[\kappa])),\\
      \quad\kw{force}\ (\Lambda \kappa. \kw{snd}\ (\elim{deStreamCons}^\kappa\ (\ident{x}[\kappa]))))
    \end{array}
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
In this definition we have made use of a feature of our type system
that states that the type equality $\forall \kappa. A \equiv A$ holds
whenever $\kappa$ is not free in $A$. Our system also includes other
type equalities that demonstrate how clock quantification interacts
with other type formers. These are presented in
\autoref{sec:type-equality} below.

In the presence of clock variables, our definition of $\ident{take}$
is well-typed and we get the function we desire: taking a finite
observation of a piece of infinite data:
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \defn{take} :: \tyname{Natural} \to (\forall \kappa. \tyname{Stream}^\kappa) \to [\tyname{Integer}] \\
    \defn{take}\ 0\ \ident{s} = [] \\
    \defn{take}\ (\ident{n}+1)\ \ident{s} = \ident{x} \mathop{\cons{:}} \ident{take}\ \ident{n}\ \ident{s'} \\
    \quad \kw{where}\ (\ident{x}, \ident{s'}) = \elim{deStreamCons}\ \ident{s}
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}

\subsection{Main Results of this Paper}
\label{sec:main-results-intro}

We are now in a position to state the main technical results of this
paper. In \autoref{sec:type-system} we present a type system that
includes a notion of strictly positive type operator\footnote{Our
  semantics can actually handle least fixpoints of positive type
  constructors and not just strictly positive ones. We restrict to
  strictly positive inductive types so that we also admit the
  possibility of a set-theoretic semantics.}. We include a least
fixpoint operator $\mu X. F[X]$. For normal strictly positive type
operators $F$ (i.e. ones that do not involve the $\delay\kappa$
operator), $\mu X. F[X]$ is exactly the normal least fixpoint of
$F$. Thus we can define the normal well-founded types of natural
numbers, lists, trees and so on. Our calculus contains constructors
$\cons{Cons$_F$} :: F[\mu X. F] \to \mu X. F$ for building values of
these types, and recursion combinators for eliminating values:
\begin{displaymath}
  \elim{primRec$_{F,A}$} :: (F[(\mu X. F) \times A] \to A) \to \mu X. F[X] \to A 
\end{displaymath}
We opt to use primitive recursion instead of a fold operator
(i.e. $\ident{fold} :: (F[A] \to A) \to \mu X. F[X] \to A$) because
it allows for constant time access to the top-level of an inductive
data structure.

We show in the proof of \thmref{thm:initial-f-algebra} that $\mu X. F$
is the carrier of the initial $F$-algebra in our model. Therefore, we
may use standard reasoning techniques about initial algebras to reason
about programs written using the $\elim{primRec}$ combinator.

When we consider strictly positive type operators of the form
$F[\delay\kappa X]$, where $\kappa$ does not appear in $F$ then, in
addition to $\mu X. F[\delay\kappa X]$ being the least fixpoint of the
operator $F[\delay\kappa -]$, it is also the \emph{greatest}
fixpoint. The $\ident{unfold}$ combinator can be implemented in terms
of the $\kw{fix}$ operator, and $\cons{Cons}$:
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}[t]{l}
    \defn{unfold$_F$} :: \forall \kappa. (A \to F[\delay\kappa A]) \to A \to \mu X. F[\delay\kappa X] \\
    \defn{unfold$_F$} = \Lambda \kappa.\lambda \ident{f}. \kw{fix}[\kappa]\ (\lambda \ident{g}\ \ident{a}. \cons{Cons}\ (\ident{fmap}_F\ (\lambda \ident{x}. \ident{g} \circledast \ident{x})\ (\ident{f}\ \ident{a})))
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
where $\ident{fmap}_F :: (A \to B) \to (F[A] \to F[B])$ is the
functorial mapping combinator associated with the strictly positive
type operator $F$. Note that without the additional $\delay\kappa$ in
$F[\delay\kappa -]$, there would be no way to define $\ident{unfold}$,
due to the typing of $\kw{fix}$.

To make observations on elements, we define a $\ident{deCons$_F$}$
combinator for every $F$, using the primitive recursion
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \defn{deCons$_F$} :: \forall \kappa. (\mu X. F[\delay\kappa X]) \to F[\delay\kappa \mu X. F[\delay\kappa X]] \\
    \defn{deCons$_F$} = \Lambda \kappa. \elim{primRec}\ (\lambda \ident{x}.\ \ident{fmap}_{F[\delay\kappa-]}\ (\lambda \ident{y}.\kw{fst}\ \ident{y})\ \ident{x})
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
The proof of \thmref{thm:final-f-de-coalgebra} shows that these
definitions of $\ident{unfold$_F$}$ and $\ident{deCons$_F$}$ exhibit
$\mu X. F[\delay\kappa X]$ as the final $F[\delay\kappa-]$-coalgebra,
using $\ident{deCons$_F$}$ as the structure map. This means that
$\ident{unfold$_F$}[\kappa] f$ is the unique $F[\delay\kappa-]$-coalgebra
homomorphism from $\mu X. F[\delay\kappa-]$ to $A$.

\thmref{thm:final-f-de-coalgebra} only gives us final coalgebras in
the case when the recursion in the type is guarded by the type
constructor $\delay\kappa-$. So we do not yet have a dual to the least
fixpoint type constructor $\mu X. F$. However, as we hinted above in
the case of streams, we can use clock quantification to construct a
final $F$-coalgebra, where $F$ need not contain an occurence of
$\delay\kappa-$.

For the type $\forall \kappa. \mu X. F[\delay\kappa-]$ we define an
$\ident{unfold$^\nu_F$}$ operator, in a similar style to the
$\ident{unfold$_F$}$ operator above. However, this operator takes an
argument of type $(A \to F[A])$, with no mention of guardedness.
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \defn{unfold$^\nu_F$} :: (A \to F[A]) \to A \to \forall \kappa. \mu X. F[\delay\kappa X] \\
    \defn{unfold$^\nu_F$} = \lambda \ident{f}\ \ident{a}. \Lambda \kappa. \\
    \quad\quad\kw{fix}[\kappa]\ (\lambda \ident{g}\ \ident{a}. \cons{Cons}\ (\ident{fmap}_F (\lambda \ident{x}. \ident{g} \circledast \kw{pure}\ \ident{x})\ (\ident{f}\ \ident{a})))\ \ident{a}
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
We can also define the corresponding deconstructor, building on the
definition of $\ident{deCons$_F$}$ above, but also using the $\kw{force}$
construct in conjunction with clock quantification. This is a
generalisation of the definition of $\elim{deStreamCons}$ above.
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \defn{deCons$^\nu_F$} :: (\forall \kappa. \mu X. F[\delay\kappa X]) \to F[\forall \kappa. \mu X. F[\delay\kappa X]] \\
    \defn{deCons$^\nu_F$} = \ident{fmap$_F$}\ (\lambda x. \kw{force}\ x)\ (\Lambda \kappa. \ident{deCons$_F$}[\kappa]\ (x[\kappa]))
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
In the application of $\ident{fmap$_F$}$, we make use of the type
equalities in our calculus, which allow us to treat the types $\forall
\kappa. F[X]$ and $F[\forall \kappa. X]$ as equivalent, when $\kappa$
does not appear in $F$. We present the type equalities in
\autoref{sec:type-equality}, and prove them sound in
\autoref{sec:type-interp}.

Our last main technical result, \thmref{thm:final-f-coalgebra}, states
that, in the semantics we define \autoref{sec:semantics}, $\forall
\kappa. \mu X. F[\delay\kappa-]$ actually is the final
$F$-coalgebra. The use of clock quantification has allowed us to
remove mention of the guardedness type constructor, and given us a way
to safely program and reason about $F$-coalgebras.

% FIXME: explain why $\exists \kappa. \mu X. F[\delay\kappa X]$ isn't
% the initial algebra for $F$

\subsection{Circular Traversals of Trees}

We now present a perhaps unexpected application of the use of clock
quantification that does not relate to ensuring productivity of
recursive programs generating infinite data. An interesting use of
laziness in functional programming languages is to peform single-pass
transformations of data structures that would appear to require at
least two passes. A classic example, due to Bird
\cite{bird84circular}, is the $\ident{replaceMin}$ function that
replaces each value in a binary tree with the minimum of all the
values in the tree, in a single pass. In normal Haskell, this function
is written as follows:
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \defn{replaceMin} :: \tyname{Tree} \to \tyname{Tree} \\
    \defn{replaceMin}\ \ident{t} = \kw{let}\ (\ident{t'}, \ident{m}) = \ident{replaceMinBody}\ (\ident{t}, \ident{m})\ \kw{in}\ \ident{t'} \\
    \hspace{0.6cm} \kw{where} \\
    \hspace{1cm} \defn{replaceMinBody}\ (\cons{Leaf}\ \ident{x},\ \ident{m}) = (\cons{Leaf}\ \ident{m}, \ident{x}) \\
    \hspace{1cm} \defn{replaceMinBody}\ (\cons{Br}\ \ident{l}\ \ident{r},\ \ident{m}) = \\
    \hspace{2cm} \kw{let}\ (\ident{l'}, \ident{m$_l$}) = \ident{replaceMinBody}\ \ident{l}\ \ident{m} \\
    \hspace{2cm} \textcolor{white}{\kw{let}\ }(\ident{r'}, \ident{m$_r$}) = \ident{replaceMinBody}\ \ident{r}\ \ident{m} \\
    \hspace{2cm} \kw{in}\ (\cons{Br}\ \ident{l'}\ \ident{r'},\ \ident{min}\ \ident{m$_l$}\ \ident{m$_r$})
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
The interesting part of this function is the first $\kw{let}$
expression. This takes the minimum value $\ident{m}$ computed by the
traversal of the tree and passes it into the \emph{same} traversal to
build the new tree. Intuitively, the reason that this works is that
the overall minimum value is never used in the computation of the
minimum, only the construction of the new tree. The computation of the
minimum and the construction of the new tree conceptually exist at
different moments in time, and it is only safe to treat them the same
after both have finished.

Using explicit clock variables we can give a version of the
$\ident{replaceMin}$ definition that demonstrates that we have
actually defined a total function from trees to trees. The use of
clock variables allows us to be explicit about the time when various
operations are taking place.

Out first step is to replace the circular use of $\kw{let}$ with a
\emph{trace} combinator defined in terms of the $\kw{fix}$ operator:
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \defn{trace} :: \forall \kappa.\ ((A[\kappa], \delay\kappa U) \to (B[\kappa], U)) \to A[\kappa] \to B[\kappa] \\
    \defn{trace} = \Lambda \kappa. \lambda \ident{f}\ \ident{a}. \\
    \quad\quad\kw{fst}\ (\kw{fix}\ (\lambda \ident{h}\ \ident{a}.\ \ident{f}\ (\ident{a}, \kw{pure}\ (\lambda \ident{x}. \kw{snd}\ \ident{x}) \circledast (\ident{h} \circledast \kw{pure}\ \ident{a})))\ \ident{a})
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
In the application of the $\kw{fix}$ operator, $h : \delay\kappa (A
\to (B \times U))$.  The notation $A[\kappa]$ (and $B[\kappa]$)
indicates that $\kappa$ may appear free in the types $A$ and $B$. %FIXME: relationship to trace defined from normal fix?

We have named this definition $\ident{trace}$ due to similarity of its
type to the trace operator of traced symmetric monoidal categories
\cite{something}. Trace operators provide an axiomatisaion of the
notion of feedback operator that has many applications in denotational
semantics. The key difference with our definition is that the first
occurence of the ``feedback type'' $U$ is guarded by the guardedness
type constructor. This will prevent us from writing definitions that
get ahead of themselves and access data that is not yet ready.

\newcommand{\hlchange}[1]{\colorbox{greybg}{#1}}

We now rewrite the $\ident{replaceMinBody}$ function so that we can
apply $\ident{trace}$ to it. We have \hlchange{highlighted} the
changes from the previous definition.
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \defn{replaceMinBody} :: \hlchangem{\forall \kappa.}(\tyname{Tree},\hlchangem{\delay\kappa}\tyname{Integer}) \to (\hlchangem{\delay\kappa}\tyname{Tree},\tyname{Integer}) \\
    \hspace{0cm} \defn{replaceMinBody}\ (\cons{Leaf}\ \ident{x},\ \ident{m}) = (\hlchangem{\kw{pure}}\cons{Leaf}\ \hlchangem{\circledast}\ident{m}, \ident{x}) \\
    \hspace{0cm} \defn{replaceMinBody}\ (\cons{Br}\ \ident{l}\ \ident{r},\ \ident{m}) = \\
    \hspace{2cm} \kw{let}\ (\ident{l'}, \ident{m$_l$}) = \ident{replaceMinBody}\ \ident{l}\ \ident{m} \\
    \hspace{2cm} \textcolor{white}{\kw{let}\ }(\ident{r'}, \ident{m$_r$}) = \ident{replaceMinBody}\ \ident{r}\ \ident{m} \\
    \hspace{2cm} \kw{in}\ (\hlchangem{\kw{pure}}\cons{Br}\ \hlchangem{\circledast}\ident{l'}\ \hlchangem{\circledast}\ident{r'},\ \ident{min}\ \ident{m$_l$}\ \ident{m$_r$})
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
The changes required are minor: we must change the type, and use the
applicative functor structure of $\delay\kappa$ to indicate when
computations are taking place ``tomorrow''.

Applying $\ident{trace}$ to $\ident{replaceMinBody}$, and using
$\kw{force}$ to remove the now redundant occurence of $\delay\kappa$,
we can define the full $\ident{replaceMin}$ function in our system:
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \defn{replaceMin} :: \tyname{Tree} \to \tyname{Tree} \\
    \defn{replaceMin}\ \ident{t} = \kw{force}\ (\Lambda \kappa. \ident{trace}[\kappa]\ (\ident{replaceMinBody}[\kappa])\ \ident{t})
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
By the soundness property of our system that we prove in
\autoref{sec:semantics}, we are assured that we have defined a total
function from trees to trees. The standard Haskell type system does
not provide this guarantee.

\subsection{Content and Contributions of this Paper}

In the next section, \autoref{sec:background} we place our work in the
context of previous work on guarded recursion and safe
coprogramming. In \autoref{sec:type-system} we formally define our
typed $\lambda$-calculus, which includes the features of inductive
types, guarded recursion and clock quantification that we introduced
above. We endow our calculus with a denotational semantics in
\autoref{sec:semantics}.  The denotational semantics allows us to
prove the key semantic soundness property, which entails productivity
for all definitions we make in the calculus. It also allows to derive
the key initial and final (co)algebras properties we desire from our
calculus. In \autoref{sec:conclusions}, we set out our conclusions.

We identify the contributions of this paper as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We define an extension of Nakano's guarded recursion calculus
  that incorporates inductive types and clock quantification. The
  combination of these features allows the programmer to express
  corecursion in a convienient way, without needing express everything
  by means of $\ident{unfold}$ operators.
\item We give a denotational semantics for our calculus that allows us
  to prove semantic type soundness for all well-typed terms, and to
  show that initial and final (co)algebras exist in our calculus.
\item Our denotational semantics can also be read as a translation
  from well-typed terms of our calculus into the untyped lazy
  $\lambda$-calculus. Thus we have also described a compilation scheme
  for our calculus, and our semantic type soundness property shows
  that it is correct.
\item We also describe several examples of the use of our calculus,
  highlight its effectiveness for defining corecursive programs. An
  unexpected additional benefit is the ability to handle circular
  programs such as Bird's $\ident{replaceMin}$ function, which do not
  use coinductive data types.
\end{enumerate}
