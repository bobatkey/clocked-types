 ABSTRACT={For programming languages whose denotational semantics uses
 fixed  points of domain constructors of mixed variance, proofs of
 correspondence  between operational and denotational semantics
 (or between two different denotational semantics) often depend upon
 the existence of  relations specified as the fixed point of
 non-monotonic operators.  This paper describes a new approach to
 constructing such relations  which avoids having to delve into
 the detailed construction of the  recursively defined domains
 themselves. The method is introduced by  example, by considering
 the proof of computational adequacy of a  denotational semantics
 for expression evaluation in a simple, untyped  functional
 programming language.}}
